# 📰 Fake News Detection - ML Project

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to detect whether a news article is *real* or *fake*.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- PassiveAggressiveClassifier
- TfidfVectorizer

## 📁 Dataset
- `fake.csv` – Fake news articles
- `true.csv` – Real news articles

## 🧠 ML Algorithm
- The model uses a Passive Aggressive Classifier to identify the reliability of news text.

## ✅ Accuracy
Achieved **99.55% accuracy** on the test data.

## 📊 Output
Sample Input:
> *"Narendra Modi appointed as Prime Minister of India"*

Prediction:
> **REAL**

## 📌 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
